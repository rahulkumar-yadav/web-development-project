## Project Implementation

1. **Desktop Scroll Behavior:** Mimicked the scroll behavior demonstrated in the [first video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJRYx5M0ZGrIOFzHlas-GHLOwxFr_Wq5/view?usp=sharing), ensuring precise replication of UI and effects.

2. **Mobile Responsive Design:** Implemented responsive behavior for mobile screens based on the [second video's UI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OZVhnkSiqYy1beWHqQ6WWnYjMfEGBpMD/view?usp=sharing) to achieve a seamless experience on mobile devices.

3. **OnScroll Effects:** Leveraged GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and ScrollMagic for onScroll effects. Explore resources like [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/), and [ScrollMagic Examples](https://scrollmagic.io/examples/index.html).

4. **Path Slider Implementation:** Integrated a path slider using resources such as [Path Slider JS](https://www.cssscript.com/fancy-svg-path-slider-path-slider-js/), [Animating SVG Paths with JavaScript](https://scotch.io/tutorials/animating-more-elements-along-svg-paths-with-javascript-part-2909), and [Path Slider GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lmgonzalves/path-slider).

5. **SVG Slider Animation:** Utilized TweenMax from GSAP for SVG slider animation. Refer to the [TweenMax Library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap/2.1.3).
